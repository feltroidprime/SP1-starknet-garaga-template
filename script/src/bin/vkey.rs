//! # SP1 Program Verification Key Extractor
//!
//! This utility extracts the verification key for an SP1 program, which is required
//! for configuring the on-chain verification contract. The verification key uniquely
//! identifies the SP1 program and ensures that only proofs generated for this specific
//! program will be accepted by the verification contract.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --bin vkey
//! ```
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! The script outputs a hexadecimal string representing the verification key:
//! ```
//! 0x00ee2a4a1c9c659ed802a544aa469136e72e1a1538af94fce56705576b48f247
//! ```
//!
//! ## Integration
//!
//! Copy this verification key and update the `SP1_PROGRAM` constant in your
//! Starknet verification contract (`contracts/src/lib.cairo`):
//!
//! ```cairo
//! const SP1_PROGRAM: u256 = 0x00ee2a4a1c9c659ed802a544aa469136e72e1a1538af94fce56705576b48f247;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Security Note
//!
//! The verification key is derived from the compiled SP1 program binary and
//! changes whenever the program logic is modified. Always regenerate and update
//! the verification key after making changes to the SP1 program.

/// This function:
/// 1. Creates a CPU-based prover client (faster for key generation)
/// 2. Sets up the program to generate the verification key
/// 3. Extracts the verification key in hexadecimal format
/// 4. Displays the key for use in the verification contract
///
/// ## Key Properties
///
/// The verification key:
/// - Uniquely identifies the SP1 program
/// - Is deterministic (same program = same key)
/// - Is required for on-chain proof verification
/// - Must match between proof generation and verification
